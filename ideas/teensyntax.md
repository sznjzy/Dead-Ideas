# TeenSyntax

A modern education platform to learn coding in an engaging way (for young kids/teenagers getting into coding).

# Why

A visually aesthetic, colourful and engaging UI/UX is necessary to capture a kid's attention and enhance their interest in coding/programming. 
Platforms such as these, that are effective and aimed at the younger generation are a rarity and if executed right can get more people 
invested in coding at a young age, which will lead them to become good programmers as they grow up.

# How
The main objective should be to make the platform engaging for teens.

- A brief and simple, ***interactive*** introduction to programming using animations and suitable audio.
- Provide a curriculum on QBasic for complete beginners and Python for those who already have a basic idea of programming.
- Colorful animations throughout most of the UI.

# Challenges faced

- There are too many coding education platforms already, but this should not be *just another one* of those.
- Retaining the attention of young kids to what's happening on screen can be difficult, if not thought out properly.

# Good to have features

- Extrovert Mode: Connect teenagers of the same age and create a healthy and mildly competitive environment.
- Introvert Mode: Integration with Spotify or other music services to create an environment that helps teenagers learn by themselves.
